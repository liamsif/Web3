        <h2>Azrieli</h2>
        <p>
            Azrieli Towers, or "Azrieli Center", is a complex of three skyscrapers, the tallest of which is 49 floors. The construction of two of the three towers and the mall was completed at the end of 1999 and the third tower was completed in late 2007. The towers are located in the center of Tel Aviv between Derech Begin on the west and Ayalon lanes on the east.
            <br /> <br />
            The cross-sectional shapes of the towers are round, triangular and square, so the towers are a cylinder, a triangular prism and a square prism. These shapes make up the Azrieli Center logo. Two pedestrian bridges lead to the Azrieli Center - one connects it to the Tel Aviv Hashalom train station to its east, and the other, known as the Azrieli Bridge, connects it with the Kirya. The towers are one of the salient features of the city's skyline.
        </p>
        <h2>The Towers</h2>
        <p>
            Before the construction of the center and the towers, there was a parking lot for garbage trucks for the Tel Aviv Municipality. The center and the towers are named after the project's developer, architect David Azrieli. The project was originally supposed to be called the "Peace Center", a name given by the municipality, due to its location on the Peace Road. The planning of the complex was done in its early stages by David Azrieli and Eli Atia and its uniqueness is considered one of the reasons why the Azrieli Group (Kenit) won the municipality's tender to purchase the land (its bid was not the highest). After Azrieli wanted to change the planning, Attia tried to torpedo it by legal means. The dispute reached an arbitration, Azrieli won and changed the plan. The architectural services were provided by the architect Chaika Friedman from the Yaski-Sivan office. The design of the facades of the towers later became a symbol of the city of Tel Aviv.
            <br /><br />
            The round tower is the tallest of the three. It is 49 floors and is 187 meters high. Its construction began in 1996 and was completed three years later. He was the tallest skyscraper in Israel from 1999 until 2001, when he lost his debut to the Moshe Aviv Tower. The diameter of the building is 44 meters and its circumference is 141 meters. The area of ​​each floor is 1,530 square meters.
            The triangular tower is lower, about 169 meters high and is 46 stories high. Its construction continued between 1996 and 1999.
            <br /><br />
            The tower has an even rectangular shape, with a height of about 154 meters and 42 floors. Construction of the square tower began in 1998 and was halted after the completion of only two floors due to a dispute with the Tel Aviv Municipality. It was renewed in 2006 and completed in 2007.
            The towers house mostly offices, but also a branch of the Holmes Place Fitness Club and evening schools. In 2008, a 272-room business hotel of the Crowne Plaza hotel brand, owned by businessman Lev Leviev, was opened in the square tower. The hotel is located on the lower 13 floors of the tower, and leads to a separate entrance from the entrance floor of the complex. At the top of the round tower is an observatory-restaurant overlooking Tel Aviv and Gush Dan.
