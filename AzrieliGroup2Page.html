            <h1>History</h1>
            <p class="p">
                The Azrieli Group was founded in 1983 as the Israeli arm of the international real estate activity of the Canadian-Israeli architect David Azrieli. It is the first to be called a "mall", a linguistic renewal devised by David Azrieli (on the basis of "buy" and "parking lot") and absorbed into Hebrew.
                <br />
                Subsequently, the company built the Negev Mall in Be'er Sheva, the Jerusalem Mall, and Azrieli Towers - the largest business center in Israel, and acquired a number of additional malls, such as the Holon Mall, the Haifa Mall and others. With the acquisition of IC in 1997, real estate projects were added to the group, including 2 malls in Hod Hasharon and Holon and a commercial center in Herzliya. -2021 is the fourth largest company traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange with a market value of NIS 36.7 billion.
                <br /><br />
                After the death of David Azrieli in 2016, his daughter, Dana Azrieli, was appointed chairman of the group's board of directors, having held key positions in the company, and during her tenure the group entered activities in other areas such as data centers, hotels and sheltered housing.
                <br />
                Azrieli Ayalon, a mall built by the group and owned by it, is one of the first malls in the country and the first one called "Mall".
                In 2016, the group also entered the field of online commerce, by acquiring the Buy2 website, which was established by the Internet entrepreneur Aviv Refuah, for an estimated amount of NIS 80 million. The website, renamed "Azrieli.com", was launched in early 2017. In July 2019, Azrieli entered the data center business by acquiring 20% ​​of the American service farm company Compass, and in July 2021, it acquired a Norwegian company in the field, called Green Mountain, for NIS 2.3 billion.
