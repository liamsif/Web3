                    • In late 1999, while the towers were not yet inhabited, a countdown to the top of the Triangle Tower was conducted towards the year 2000, using digits and giant letters created by computer-controlled lighting. Since then, the towers have served as a platform for presenting various messages to the general public, through lighting design designed for them. Among other things, they were presented with a project to raise national morale, and every year on Independence Day they are lit in the shape of the Israeli flag.
                    <br /><br />
                    • In 2003, the towers began a local tradition of - "leap uphill", a stair race in which competitors climb up 1,144 steps in the round tower to the helipad at the top.

                    In 2006 a tradition of a series of spinning classes began on the helicopter landing pad at the top of the round tower. In 2007 there were 24 lessons in a row, which started on Thursday afternoon and ended before the beginning of Shabbat.
