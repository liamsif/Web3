                In May 2013, the Azrieli Group acquired the Yedioth Ahronoth building near the towers, with the aim of demolishing it and erecting another tower in its place - an elliptical. The elliptical tower is expected to include 90 floors and will rise to a height of about 350 meters.  In the new tower, office floors, commercial areas (as an extension of the existing mall area), public areas, housing units and floors for sheltered housing are to be built. The plan was approved by the District Planning Commission in October 2017. 
                <br />
                In December 2018, the latest plan for the tower was announced, which will be elliptical, but will also be designed in a spiral shape, so its design will be different from its predecessors. The new tower was designed by the architectural firm "Kohn Pedersen Fox" together with Moshe Tzur and according to the published details, will include 91 floors and will rise to a height of about 350 meters.  It was also reported that construction work has begun and is under construction and excavation, and its construction will be completed in late 2025. The tower base includes a 6-level underground car park (which can be converted to other uses in the future after projects such as light rail reduce demand for private vehicles). 45,000 square meters plus a commercial floor with a direct connection to King Saul station, as well as several commercial floors that will add about 13,000 square meters of commercial space to the mall at the base of the towers, along with about 2,000 square meters of public space designated for kindergartens. The tower is designed for office space and 273 luxury apartments, as well as sheltered housing for the "Palace" sheltered housing chain from Beit Azrieli. The tower will have 43 elevators and on the top floor a restaurant is planned that overlooks the urban landscape as well as an observation floor that allows a 360-degree perimeter view.

                In January 2021 a final building permit was obtained for the building. <a style="cursor: pointer;" onclick="picF()">Click me to swap a picture</a>
